Project Report: Interactive Recipe Gallery App
Overview
This report outlines the design choices and development challenges encountered while building an Interactive Recipe Gallery App using React Native with the Expo framework. The application allows users to browse through a gallery of recipes, viewing detailed images and descriptions, and navigate using "Next" and "Previous" buttons.

Design Choices
Framework and Libraries:

React Native and Expo: Chosen for their robust ecosystems and ability to rapidly prototype cross-platform mobile applications. Expo's managed workflow provided many built-in features which simplified setup and deployment.
useState Hook: Used to manage the gallery's state, specifically the current index of the displayed image. This choice was driven by React's powerful capabilities for building dynamic user interfaces with state management.
Gallery Component Structure:

The Gallery component is central to the application, designed to handle user interactions and display the recipe images and descriptions. It was implemented as a functional component utilizing hooks, aligning with modern React best practices.
Navigation System:

Simple "Next" and "Previous" buttons were implemented to navigate between images. The buttons update the state of the current index, triggering a re-render of the Gallery component.
Boundary checks were added to the navigation buttons to prevent errors at the ends of the image list (e.g., disabling the "Next" button when on the last image).
Data Management:

Static Data Source: A JavaScript file (imageList.js) contains the image data, which includes IDs, URLs, and descriptions. This method was chosen for its simplicity and ease of maintenance for a small set of data.
Challenges Encountered
Expo CLI Updates:

During the initial setup, I encountered deprecation notices for the global expo-cli. Switching to the local CLI recommended by Expo's recent updates (SDK 46 and higher) required adjustments in how I run commands, moving from global expo commands to npx expo.
Navigation Logic:

Implementing the navigation logic with boundary conditions posed a minor challenge. Ensuring that the navigation buttons behaved correctly at the edges of the image list (first and last images) required careful state management.
Metro Configuration Error:

A significant issue arose with an error related to ExpoMetroConfig.loadAsync not being a function, likely due to version mismatches between Expo and Metro bundler configurations. Resolving this involved clearing node modules, updating dependencies, and ensuring compatibility across the environment.

Layout and Styling:

Achieving a responsive and aesthetically pleasing layout across different devices took several iterations. React Native’s styling system, while powerful, required adjustments to align with the desired design specifications.
Conclusion
Building the Interactive Recipe Gallery App provided a comprehensive learning experience in handling state, navigating React Native’s ecosystem, and overcoming environmental setup challenges. The application meets the project's requirements effectively, demonstrating a practical understanding of React components, state management, and mobile app development best practices. This project has not only bolstered my technical skills but also improved my problem-solving capabilities in the context of mobile application development.
